Unlike anorexia, individuals with bulimia are often within or above a normal weight range, making it harder to detect. The condition can cause severe medical complications including gastrointestinal damage, electrolyte imbalances, heart arrhythmias, and tooth decay.

Pica can lead to serious medical complications including poisoning, intestinal blockages, infections, and nutritional deficiencies.
